I will work with a dataset about unicorn companies, discovering characteristics of the data, structuring it in ways that will help me draw meaningful insights, and using visualizations to analyze the data. Ultimately, I will draw conclusions about significant trends or patterns I find in the dataset. This will develop my skills in EDA and my knowledge of functions that allow me to structure data.
